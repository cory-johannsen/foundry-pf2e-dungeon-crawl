## Versioning

Every merge to `main` must bump the `version` field in `module.json`.
Foundry VTT uses this manifest version for update detection, so an
un-bumped version after a merge means installed copies won't see the
change as an update.

- Patch bump (`x.y.Z` → `x.y.Z+1`) for routine fixes and small changes.
- Minor bump (`x.Y.0` → `x.Y+1.0`) for larger features or
  architecture-level changes (e.g. `0.1.2` → `0.2.0` for the
  dependency-direction reversal).
- If several commits land in one push, a single catch-up bump covering
  all of them is fine — it doesn't need to be one bump per commit.
